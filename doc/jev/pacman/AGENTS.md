# Pac-Man + jev decision-model control

## What this is

`pacman.html` is a single-file, canvas-based Pac-Man clone (maze, 4 ghosts
with scatter/chase/frightened modes, pellets, power pellets). `server.js` is
a small zero-dependency Node HTTP server that turns it into something a
"jev"-style decision model (see `../jev.md` / `req.md`) can watch and drive
over plain HTTP, while keyboard play keeps working exactly as before.

This directory (`doc/jev/pacman/`) holds the game + server; `../jev.md` one
level up has the original `ollama`/jev decision-model notes this was built
from.

Concretely, this lets you:
- open the game in a browser and watch it **play itself**, driven by a local
  Ollama decision model (`tev1:4b`, same shape as the `jev.md` examples), or
- drive/inspect it yourself with plain `curl`, with no model involved.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `pacman.html` | The game. Unmodified gameplay/rendering, plus a small bridge at the bottom of the script that syncs state to/from `server.js` every 200ms. Keyboard input (arrows/WASD, P, R) is untouched and always works, even if the server is down. |
| `server.js` | `node server.js` — serves `pacman.html` at `/`, exposes the HTTP API below, and runs the autoplay loop that asks Ollama for the next move. |
| `req.md` | The original feature request this was built from. |
| `../jev.md` | Original `ollama /v1/systemone` "jev" decision-model request/response notes (one directory up, shared with other things under `doc/jev/`). |

## Running it

```bash
cd doc/jev/pacman
node server.js              # http://localhost:8787
PORT=9000 node server.js    # custom port
```

Open `http://localhost:8787/` in a browser. Autoplay is **on by default** —
if Ollama is reachable at `http://localhost:11434/v1/systemone` with the
`tev1:4b` model pulled (`ollama pull tev1:4b`), the game starts playing
itself immediately. If Ollama isn't reachable, the page just sits idle
(no fallback AI — see "Design decisions" below) until Ollama answers or you
move it yourself via keyboard/API.

Env vars (all optional):

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8787` | HTTP port |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1/systemone` | decision-model endpoint |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `tev1:4b` | model name sent in the request |
| `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1500` | abort a stalled ollama call after this long |
| `AUTOPLAY_INTERVAL_MS` | `400` | how often autoplay asks for the next move |
| `AUTOPLAY` | (unset = on) | set to `off` to start with autoplay disabled |

## HTTP API

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | the game page |
| `GET /api/state` | current state for a human or a model: Pac-Man tile/direction/legal moves, all 4 ghosts (position, status, distance), a 7x7 text window around Pac-Man, the full maze grid, score/lives/level/pellets. `503` until a browser tab has connected. |
| `GET /api/decision` | the same state, pre-packaged as a ready-to-curl `jev`/ollama `systemone` request body (`state` text + a `move` choice question whose `criteria` are only the currently-legal directions). |
| `POST /api/move` `{"direction":"up"\|"down"\|"left"\|"right"}` | queue Pac-Man's next move — same effect as a keypress. |
| `POST /api/control` `{"action":"pause"\|"resume"\|"restart"}` | control the game externally. |
| `GET /api/autoplay` / `POST /api/autoplay {"enabled":true\|false}` | inspect/toggle the self-play loop (also toggleable from the on-page button). |

Examples:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/state
curl http://localhost:8787/api/decision
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/move -d '{"direction":"up"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/control -d '{"action":"restart"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/autoplay -d '{"enabled":false}'
```

## How the browser <-> server bridge works

`pacman.html` can't expose HTTP endpoints by itself (it's just a page), so
`server.js` sits in between:

1. Every 200ms the page `POST`s its full live state to `/api/sync`.
2. The server stores that as `latestState` (what `/api/state` and
   `/api/decision` read from) and replies with any pending direction/action
   commands that were queued via `/api/move`, `/api/control`, or the
   autoplay loop.
3. The page applies those commands exactly like a keypress (`pac.next = ...`)
   and keeps rendering/simulating locally as normal.

If the server is unreachable, the page's `fetch` calls just fail silently
(caught) and keyboard play is unaffected — the "API: offline" badge shows
under the maze.

## Autoplay loop (the self-play part)

`server.js` runs a sequential loop (`autoplayTick`, scheduled via
`setTimeout`, not an overlapping `setInterval`) that, once a game page is
connected:

1. Builds a `jev`-style decision request from the latest state
   (`buildDecisionPrompt`).
2. `POST`s it to `OLLAMA_URL` with model `OLLAMA_MODEL`.
3. Reads `answers.move.choice` from the response and queues it as the next
   move.
4. Logs one line per tick, including how long the Ollama call took:
   `[ollama] -> left (157ms)` or `[ollama] call failed after 1500ms: <reason>`.
5. If the game reaches `gameover`, queues a `restart` so the demo keeps
   running indefinitely.

### Design decision: no built-in fallback AI

An earlier version of this included a built-in heuristic (BFS to the
nearest pellet + ghost-avoidance scoring) that took over whenever Ollama
was unreachable. **This was removed at the user's request** — autoplay now
depends entirely on Ollama. If it's unreachable, no move is queued and the
page just shows "Autoplay: ON (ollama unreachable)" until it answers again.
Keyboard and the `/api/move` / `/api/control` endpoints still work regardless.

## Bug found and fixed in the original game engine

While testing autoplay (score stayed at 0 despite Pac-Man visibly moving),
a pre-existing bug was found in `pacman.html`'s movement code — present
before any of the above changes, affecting plain keyboard play too:

- `updatePac()`/`updateGhost()` each have two separate "snap to tile
  center" code paths: a loose-tolerance (`EPS = 0.06`) turning-check at the
  top of the function, and the movement loop's own exact-arrival check
  further down (the one that calls `eatAt()`/`wrap()`).
- Because a single frame's movement step is similar in size to `EPS`, the
  turning-check almost always fired first and force-rounded the position to
  the tile center *before* the exact-arrival check could ever detect
  "arrived" — so `eatAt()` (pellet consumption / scoring) was silently
  skipped on nearly every tile crossing, for both Pac-Man and the ghosts.
- Fix: the turning-check path now also calls `wrap()` and `eatAt()` (both
  are idempotent, so doing so redundantly is harmless). Also replaced
  `Math.round(currentPos) + direction` (which flips the target tile one
  step early once position crosses a tile midpoint) with a direction-aware
  `nextCenter()` helper using `floor`/`ceil`.
- Verified via Playwright: pellets are now eaten correctly, score tracks
  exactly (10/pellet, 50/power-pellet), turning works, and eating a power
  pellet correctly frightens the ghosts (they turn blue, eyes-and-wobble
  animation).

## Verifying changes

There's no automated test suite here; changes were verified ad hoc with
Playwright (headless Chromium) driving the page and polling `/api/state`
to confirm score/position/ghost-status changes match expectations, plus
`node --check` on the extracted `<script>` body for a quick syntax check
after edits. If you change `pacman.html` or `server.js` again, a similar
spot-check (open the page, play a bit via keyboard or `/api/move`, confirm
score/pellets move and no console errors appear) is the fastest way to
catch regressions.
